#Contibuting to Sweep

## Welcome contributors to the project: 
Thanks for your interest in our project!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing. These are just guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Roadmap
We are currently in the process of defining our roadmap, so please check back in the near future for our roadmap.

## Testing
All testing will be done using Xcode unit testing. Please include unit tests for any and all changes you make to the framework. All pull requests will be run through Travis CI before being merged, so this is an important step.

## How to submit changes: Pull Request protocol etc. 
Feel free to tackle any of our open issues that have been tagged as `confirmed` or `help-wanted`. If you choose to start working on one, please comment on the issue to let us know your intent so we don't have someone else work on it as well.  When you are ready to submit your changes, please follow the following guidelines for pull requests:

* **Select your merge target** to be `develop`
* **Provide a general summary** of the changes you've made in 1-3 sentences
* **Provide specific summaries in check-list format** (skip any that do not apply)
	* The library/testing changes should come first
	* The documentation changes should come last
* **Update any related documentation and tests**
* **Link any related issues** using their issue number, by pasting a link
* **Periodically check back** to see if any changes have been requested

## How to report a bug: 
Bugs include any problems in the `master` branch that produce unexpected behavior. Before submitting a bug report, please do a quick search through the Github Issues to see if the bug has already been reported.

* Please include the following in all bug reports:
	* Version of the library
	* Target version of iOS
	* Xcode version

### Some tips to submitting a good bug report
**Report the problem immediately**
Donâ€™t wait to write bug report late because you can miss the important details. If you found any defects while testing, report it immediately.

**Clear title**
Keep it short. It is very important to grasp the essence of the defect from the title. Also it will help the sys admin to find it through the large database for assigning to the correct developer.

**One defect/issue per report**
No more, no less. A single bug in a report can help to avoid duplication and confusion. If you describe too many defects some of them may be overlooked.

**Reproduce the issue before submitting the report**
Make sure your actions lead to reproducing the bug without ambiguity. The defect should be reproducible.

## New Feature Requirements
New features include anything completely new or adding additional functionality to our existing functionality.

Before submitting a new feature request, please do a quick search on the issue board to see if it has already been proposed.

* When submitting a new feature, please include the following items:
	* A brief description of the change
	* Why you think this change is important?
	* Would it be a breaking change?
